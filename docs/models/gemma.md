## Model Architecture

Gemma models are built on a transformer-based architecture with several notable features:

- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**: Optimized attention implementation for better performance and reduced computational requirements
- **Responsible AI Design**: Built with safety and responsible deployment as core principles
- **Tokenizer Optimization**: Uses SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary of 256,000 tokens
- **Training Methodology**: Pre-trained on a diverse corpus of text data with additional instruction-tuning

### PaliGemma Architecture

PaliGemma models extend the Gemma architecture to support multimodal capabilities:

- **Vision Encoder**: Specialized vision transformer for processing image inputs
- **Cross-Modal Fusion**: Advanced mechanisms to align and integrate visual and textual representations
- **Unified Representation Space**: Shared semantic space for both text and visual content
- **Zero-Shot Visual Understanding**: Ability to understand and describe images without task-specific fine-tuning
